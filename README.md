# CS-330 Final Project: 3D Scene and Design Decisions

This repository contains my final project for **CS-330: Computational Graphics and Visualization**.  

The starter code included the base project, mesh classes, camera movement, shaders, and a simple scene with example primitives. My work built on that foundation to create a 3D scene with a textured cake, realistic lighting, and enhanced navigation controls.

## üìù Reflection

### How do I approach designing software?  
I take a top down approach and break a project into smaller pieces. I then design and implement those smaller pieces step by step until the full project is complete. For this project, I began by using simple primitives to match the reference 2D image, and then I added more detail by improving navigation and applying textures and lighting to the scene.  

### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?  
I learned how to use basic shapes to build a more complex 3D scene that closely matches a reference image. I also practiced how to use different textures to make them look natural on different surfaces and learned how to organize my code into modular reusable functions.  

### What design process did you follow for your project work?  
I focused on geometry first, then navigation, then textures, and finally lighting. Each milestone built on the last to add more details that made the scene look more like the final image.  

### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?  
Breaking a project into small steps and adding functionality in stages will be a useful process for any programming task. It makes progress easy to see and track, and it prevents the project from becoming overwhelming.

### How do I approach developing programs?  
I build software from the ground up, starting with core functionality and adding features on top of that foundation. In this project, the starter code already provided base rendering, mesh, and basic camera controls. I added my work on top of that to create the 3D carrot cake scene, improved navigation, applied textures, and set up the lighting.  

### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?  
I designed modular reusable functions like `SetTransformations`, `SetShaderTexture`, `SetShaderMaterial`, and `SetupSceneLights` to simplify the code and allow for easy reconfiguration of the scene. I also used AI tools to generate custom high resolution textures, which gave me control over the visual style of the scene.  

### How did iteration factor into your development?  
Iteration was a core part of my development process, and each milestone for this project built on top of what came before. I tested geometry first, then navigation, then textures, and finally lighting. Working in stages also made it easier to debug as I could narrow down the source of a problem to a specific change.  

### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones?  
At the beginning of the project, I was directly manipulating the meshes, but as I iterated I wrote reusable functions to handle repeated tasks. This improved the code by making it more concise and modular.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?  
Computer science gives me the ability to create and improve programs. This project gave me an understanding of how design, code, and visualization are all interconnected and will be directly applicable to future coursework and professional work.  

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?  
I learned how to create a 3D scene by using primitives to create geometry, applying textures, and lighting, and controlling a camera for navigation. These skills will be directly applicable to future coursework that uses graphics or simulation.  

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?  
Computational graphics and visualizations are used in a wide range of careers, including software development, simulation, and data visualization. Learning how to build a 3D scene from the ground up gives me a strong foundation for graphics related projects in the future.

## üìå Portfolio Contribution  
This project demonstrates my ability to take starter code and extend it into a fully realized 3D scene with objects, textures, lighting, and navigation controls. I created a carrot cake scene from the ground up using primitives, applied custom textures to different surfaces in the scene to make them look realistic, set up lighting to create a more immersive experience, and improved navigation controls. This project shows my progress and growth in the area of computational graphics and modular programming.
